# The Internet and HTML

## What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows users to access and share data, communicate with others, and use various online services.

## How does the Internet work?

The Internet works by using a system of interconnected networks that use standardized protocols to communicate with each other. When you enter a URL into your web browser, your computer sends a request to a server, which then sends the requested data back to your computer. This data is transmitted over the Internet using protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).

## Why is HTML required?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is required to create web pages that can be displayed on the Internet. HTML provides the structure and content that web browsers render to the user. Without HTML, web pages would not display text, images, links, or other multimedia content.

## What is HTML?

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It forms the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders.

## History of HTML

HTML was first introduced in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. Since then, it has undergone several revisions, with the latest version being HTML5.

## Basic HTML Structure

A basic HTML document consists of the following:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

<title>Document Title</title>

</head>

<body>

<!-- content goes here -->

</body>

</html>
```

## HTML Tags

HTML tags define elements on a web page. They typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example:

<p>This is a paragraph</p>

## HTML Elements

Headings

HTML headings are defined using <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc. They are used to define headings on a web page.

```
<h1>Main Heading</h1>

<h2>Subheading</h2>
```

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined using the <p> tag.

```
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

## Links

Links are defined using the <a> tag.

```
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
```

## Images

Images are defined using the <img> tag.

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description">
```

## Lists

HTML lists are defined using the <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags.

```
<ul>

<li>Item 1</li>

<li>Item 2</li>

<li>Item 3</li>

</ul>
```

## Semantic HTML

### What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that provides meaning to the structure of a web page, making it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content.

Semantic HTML Elements

Common semantic HTML elements include:

```
<header></header>

<nav></nav>

<main></main>

<section></section>

<article></article>

<aside></aside>

<footer></footer>
```

## HTML Tables

### Creating a Table

HTML tables are defined using the <table>, <tr>, and <td> tags.

```
<table>

<tr>

<td>Cell 1</td>

<td>Cell 2</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Cell 3</td>

<td>Cell 4</td>

</tr>

</table>
```

## HTML Forms

### Creating a Form

HTML forms are defined using the <form> tag.

```
<form>

<label for="name">Name:</label>

<input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>

<input type="submit" value="Submit">

</form>
```

# HTML5 Features

## New Semantic Elements

HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.

## Multimedia

HTML5 allows for native video and audio playback using the <video> and <audio> tags.

```
<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
```

## Canvas and SVG

HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element for dynamic graphics and the <svg> element for vector graphics.

## Best Practices
